#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


The goal of this project is to produce a tidy data file based on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##Requirements

* Data
	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

* Documentation
	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

* Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
	* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


##Implementaion

The script ``` run_analysis.R ``` performs the analysis of the source dataset and creates a tidy data file called ``` tidy_data.txt ```.
